<p class="lead">
I mainly wanted to create a website for my portfolio of work, beyond that I also wanted to create a site where I could blog about Jewish subjects and takes on events. Some of the features on this site are just to display how to do it programmatically on a website. I will eventually set up separate sites (<code>/directories</code>) for the various sects of hasidism who write articles on here. Visitors can comment, but I will filter it out so there is no spam. I will explain some of the features of the site below.

## Podcasts
There are a few really good Jewish podcasts, I will be adding more in time. On the sidebar of the site there is a simple player where you can listen to today's reading from the **Breslov Research Institute**. If you host a podcast please get in touch so we can host your episodes here as well.

## Advertising
I offer **"credits"** users can spend on the site to advertise their products, websites, and services. Free users get 5 free credits (one ad per month is 5 credits) and premium members will have 30 available to use. This is just the beginning of this site so these may change. Essentially I want you (as the owner of credits) to be able to use those to sell ad space on the site to your local shuls businesses.

## Quotes
This is just offering random quotes from great rebbes of the Hasidic traditions, email us to submit your Rabbis quotes so other users can tweet them with their friends.

## Charity
One of the foundations of hasidism is tzedakah, this site will send a portion of the revenue from all ads and subscriptions to a charity (most likely Chabad or Breslov charities), if you would like to be added to the list of charities please reach out.

#### Breslov Chaburah
This is our current charity, you can find more info on them [here](https://breslov.org/donate/)
